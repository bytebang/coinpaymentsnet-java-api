# coinpaymentsnet-java-api
Java API implementation for the cryptocoin payment provider "coinpayments.net"

This is a simple API for the coinpayments.net platform which is an integrated payment gateway for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin.
The actual API documentation can be looked up at https://www.coinpayments.net/apidoc

This implementation is a simple Java wrapper to make it useable from within your Java projects. We have tried to keep it as 
simple an clean as possible, but however there are some dependencies like slf4j, commons-codec and gson which must be resolved.
This can either be done via apache-ivy or by hand. 

Check it out and import it as eclipse project and have a look at the JUnit testcases to see how it is intended to be used.

Have fun with it !
